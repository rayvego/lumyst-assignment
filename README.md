# Enhanced Graph Arrangement and Visualization

This is completely new hierarchical arrangement algorithm and a major visual overhaul to solve the problem of graph congestion and improve readability for large codebase structures.

The original `dagre`-based layout was not ideal for our specific hierarchical data, leading to a cluttered and hard-to-read graph. This solution replaces it with a custom algorithm and enhanced styling for a much more intuitive and clean user experience.

## What I Fixed

  * **Poor Readability:** The old graph was crowded, with nodes and edges overlapping, making it difficult to understand relationships.
  * **Lack of Hierarchy:** The structure wasn't clearly hierarchical. It was hard to see the top-level categories and how they related to their sub-components.
  * **Basic Styling:** The visual design was too simple, making different types of nodes and relationships hard to tell apart.

## Summary of Changes

I have made changes to three key files to implement the new solution:

1.  `src/core/graph-format.service.tsx`: **(The Algorithm)** Replaced the generic `dagre` library with a custom, multi-level layout algorithm.
2.  `src/core/react-flow.service.tsx`: **(The Styling)** Greatly improved the visual styling of all nodes and edges to make them distinct and easy to understand.
3.  `src/app/page.tsx`: **(The UI)** Added new UI components like a legend, a background grid, and better view controls.

### 1\. `graph-format.service.tsx`: A New Hierarchical Layout Algorithm

The biggest change is in this file. I removed the `dagre` logic and built a custom layout function from scratch.

  * **Strict Hierarchical Levels:** The new algorithm places nodes in clear horizontal levels:
      * **Level 0:** Top-level C1 Categories.
      * **Level 1:** C2 Subcategories, positioned directly below their parent C1.
      * **Level 2:** Leaf nodes, arranged in a grid under their parent C2.
  * **Better Spacing:** I introduced constants like `LEVEL_HEIGHT` and `NODE_HORIZONTAL_GAP` to control the spacing. This makes the graph feel open and prevents nodes from crashing into each other.
  * **Uncategorized Nodes:** Nodes that don't belong to any category are now neatly placed in their own section at the bottom of the graph, so they don't interfere with the main structure.
  * **Final Polish with Force Layout:** After placing all the nodes in their hierarchical positions, a simple "force-directed" function (`applyAdvancedForceLayout`) runs to make small adjustments, further reducing any overlaps.

### 2\. `react-flow.service.tsx`: Richer Visual Styling

To make the graph easier to interpret, I completely redesigned the nodes and edges.

  * **Improved Node Design:**
      * Nodes now have **gradients**, **shadows**, and **larger padding/font sizes**.
      * Each node type (C1, C2, regular node) has a distinct and more vibrant color scheme.
      * The size of the nodes has been increased to make labels easier to read.
  * **Smarter Edge Design:**
      * **Relationship edges** (like C2-to-C2 connections) are now thicker, colored, and **animated** to draw attention to them. They also have clear arrowheads.
      * **Containment edges** (showing a C1 contains a C2) are now styled as light, dashed lines, making them less visually dominant.
      * Labels for edges now have a background, making them readable even when they cross other lines.

### 3\. `app/page.tsx`: Improved User Interface and Experience

Finally, I improved the main application page where the graph is displayed.

  * **Added a Legend:** A new **Panel** in the top-left corner acts as a legend. It explains what each color-coded node means and shows a count of each node type.
  * **Enhanced Background:** Added a subtle dot-pattern `<Background>` to make panning and zooming feel more natural.
  * **Better Controls:** The initial view is now better (`fitView`), and the zoom limits have been adjusted for easier navigation on large graphs.
